===================

These are my solutions for the 2021 edition of the [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com).  
These solutions are all implemented in [**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org).  

How to run
----------

Here is how you can run each solutions:

```bash
# This will run the solution for day 1.
cargo run -- 1

# This will run the solution for day 2.
cargo run -- 2

# And so on, up to day 24 ...
```
